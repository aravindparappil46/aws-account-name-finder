# AWS Account Name Finder
Chrome extension which displays the AWS Account Name on the Management Console, for SSO-based accounts!

# Why?
If you find yourself switching between multiple AWS accounts through your organization's SSO, then the current AWS profile menu on the Management Console doesn't show the name of the account you are in (It only shows the Account ID, which is not user-friendly).

This extension will display the Account Name on the Management Console's profile menu (top right menu) so that you do not have to wonder which account you have open!

# How To Install?
You can add this extension to your Google Chrome by installing it from the Chrome Web Store:
